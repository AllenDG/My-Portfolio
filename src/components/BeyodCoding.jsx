        When Iâ€™m not immersed in coding, I dedicate my time to music. I find joy
        in singing and playing instruments, which allows me to express
        creativity in new and fulfilling ways.

      <p className="text-xs">
        Music enriches my life and inspires my work, encouraging me to bring
        passion and creativity to everything I do. Whether learning a new song
        or refining my skills, music is my way of connecting beyond the world of
        technology.
